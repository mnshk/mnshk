# Hey there!
My name is Munish and I enjoy using code to make interactive things. I have a keen interest in web development. Ever since writing my first line of code, I was fascinated with the idea of using it to create something awesome.

My interest in Web development started back in 2014, when I came to know about HTML and CSS. I became passionate about technology and focused on building and designing great digital experiences.

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science, and I believe building a great software is more than just knowing how to code.
